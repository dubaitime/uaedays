The Fazaa card is primarily available to employees of the Ministry of Interior, government, and semi-government organizations, as well as frontline workers. Employees in the private sector who are locals are also eligible to apply. 

To obtain the Fazaa card, you will need a valid Emirate ID (EID) and a company code. The Fazaa program application requires the company code. If your company has not issued you a Fazaa card, you cannot apply for one as an individual. You must wait for the UAE Ministry of Interior to provide the card to you.

## How to Get a Company Code Online

In a new company, every employee should be issued a company code by the employer. It is common for companies to become members of the Fazaa program to provide this special membership to their employees. If you do not have access to a company code, follow these steps:

1. Ask your employer to name the company’s Fazaa card. If they are a member of the program, request the company code.
2. Look for ceremonies or discount events. The Ministry of Interior occasionally organizes festivals or promotional campaigns where the Fazaa card application does not require the presentation of a company code. Keep an eye out for such occasions.
3. If you are a government employee, your department should be able to provide the necessary company code. If you have difficulty obtaining it, consult with your department’s human resource contact.

## How to Apply for the Fazaa Card

Once you have obtained your company code, follow these steps to apply for the Fazaa card:

1. Visit the Fazaa official website or use the application designed for mobile devices.
2. Create an account by entering your Emirate ID and completing the necessary fields.
3. On the application page, enter your company code and proceed with the application.
4. Complete all sections of the application and provide any necessary paperwork.

As mentioned earlier, Fazaa has different statuses, each with varying conditions. Some tiers may require additional documents such as a utility bill or employment contract. Be sure to have all the necessary documents ready before applying.

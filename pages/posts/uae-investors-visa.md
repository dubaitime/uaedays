**Who is Eligible?**

*  Partners in commercial enterprises who meet specific investment criteria.

**Requirements:**
*  Approval from the Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs & Port Security (ICP) based on the investment rating system.

*  Approval from local authorities within the UAE.

Plus, you can bring your family along for the ride - pretty sweet deal, right?

### B. Golden Visa
Now this is the cream of the crop - the UAE's VIP pass, if you will. Valid for 5-10 years, the [Golden Visa](https://u.ae/en/information-and-services/visa-and-emirates-id/residence-visas/golden-visa) is like having an all-access pass to live, work, or study in the UAE. No sponsor needed!

**Who is Eligible?**

*  Investors in various sectors, including those holding public investments, real estate, or large business portfolios.

**Investor Requirements for the Golden Visa:**
*  **Public Investment:** Investors in this category must:
      *  Provide a letter from an accredited UAE investment fund, confirming a minimum deposit of AED 2 million.
      *  Alternatively, you can present a valid business license and a memorandum of association stating capital ownership of at least AED 2 million.

## Application Process for UAE Investor Visas
The application process for each investor visa type in the UAE follows similar general steps, though it’s important to carefully meet the requirements specific to your visa type. Here’s a simple step-by-step guide:

### Step 1: Gather Your Documents
The required documents generally include:
*  Proof of investment or capital (letters from accredited funds, property ownership letters, or business licenses).
*  Tax records, particularly for the Golden Visa (evidence of a minimum AED 250,000 annual tax payment).
*  Health insurance coverage for yourself and any family members you intend to sponsor.
*  For property investors, an approval letter from the emirate’s land department where the property is located.

### Step 2: Apply Online via ICP
Submit your application through the Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs & Port Security (ICP). Their official website provides application services for visa applications and renewals, ensuring a smooth process for those outside the UAE.

### Step 3: Approval and Visa Issuance
Once submitted, applications undergo a review. Approval times vary based on the visa type and specific case details. Upon approval, you’ll receive your visa electronically, which then allows you to plan your relocation or, if already in the UAE, begin your extended stay.

## Why Choose an Investor Visa in the UAE?
Let's talk perks - and there are plenty!
*  **Strategic Location:** UAE’s location connects East and West, making it ideal for businesses with a global reach.
*  **Tax Benefits:** Many UAE zones offer tax exemptions for businesses and no personal income tax, allowing investors to retain a larger portion of their income.
